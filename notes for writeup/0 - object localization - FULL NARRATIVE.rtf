\f0\fs38 \cf0 It was observed that the sensor has a cone angle of approximately 60 degrees. Longer range returns will therefore have a larger arc where the object could be. This lead us to two approaches. Firstly, we could move closer and closer to objects before localizing them. Secondly, we can get lots of readings of arcs that the object may potentially be on and then filter away the ones that are less likely a true object. These approaches are compared and contrasted in Appendix A. The approach that was selected was the second approach but we did end up restricting our ultrasonic sensor distance so it could be argued that we used the first to, to some degree. We saw the first approach as requiring more rotations of the wheels and less rotation of the ultrasonic sensor\'92s motor, while the second approach was the opposite. Since we assumed that the wheels\'92 motors would require at least 2x as many rotations as the ultrasonic sensor\'92s motor, we went with the second option.}
