\f0\fs32 \cf0 -experiment\
	The robot was placed at varying distances from a wall(h) that had no obstacles and corners in range. In addition to the varying distances the rotational orientation(theta) with respect to the wall\'92s perpendicular, was also varied. \
\
-findings\
	-Multiple returns from the wall were not observed for each configuration of \'91h\'92 and \'91theta\'92\
	-There is a critical angle that gives no returns and therefore the return is the max return. This is 2.55 units.}
