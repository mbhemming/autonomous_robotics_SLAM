It was observed from test2 that the total sweep angle was approximately 60 degrees. This large sweep angle may impair our capacity to localize objects in the environment, depending on which approach we chose to localize them. This lead to a suggested solution of augmenting the ultrasonic sensor with a tubular object to concentrate the sound waves(see picture).\
\
method: Paper was rolled up to construct a conic shape with a length of approximately 4 inches and held over the transmitter of the ultrasonic sensor. Then test2 was re-preformed. Then it was held over the receiver and re-preformed again. This was done again with a longer conic tube of approximately 8 inches.\

\
conclusion: Adding a cone can decrease the sweep angle of our ultrasonic sensor. The length of the tube and the choice of funnelling the transmitter/receiver doesn\'92t have an impact on the precision of our sweep angle. This lead us to conduct an investigation into how to optimize the morphology of our tubular attachment(See investigation1). This is lead to 3D printing \'85..WRITE THIS LATER\'85..INSERT TEST NUMBER HERE }
