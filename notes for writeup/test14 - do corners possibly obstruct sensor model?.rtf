\f0\fs36 \cf0 -reasoning behind it\
	-filling out sensor model table\
\
-experimetn\
	-put it to where there is no corner interaction, then move it to where there is a corner interaction\
	-values\
		-1.5 feet 30 degrees\
		-2.5 ft 30 degrees\
		-4 ft  20 degrees\
		4 ft 10 degred\
\
hypotheis\
	-the corner would obstruct the range when the angle of the ultrasonic sensor with respect to the beam is close to 90 degrees\
	\
\
conclusions\
	- the hypothesis was false. The corner didn\'92t effect the sensor measurement significantly. this means that we don\'92t need a separate sensor model for when we are in corners\
