## Autonomous Robotics: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

#### Demo Video:
Found in ./0-RESULTS-AND-WRITEUP

#### MATLAB Code:
 - Contains code that renders a high resolution (0.25 inch grid squares) mapping of the enviroment.
 - Intelligently determines walls
 - leverages intelligent filtering
 - Makes use of negative inforamtion. The absence of detecting objects. This leads to a surprisingly good mapping from just four 360 degree scans of the enviroment.
 - 	Image of a map from four 360 degree scans is found in './0-RESULTS-AND-WRITEUP'. The squares and circles where obstacles in the enviroment.

#### Pythond Code:
  - Runs onboard during robots motion
  - Path planning
  - Low-res object mapping optimized for robots computational power
  - Locomotion
