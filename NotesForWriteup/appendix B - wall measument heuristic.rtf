\f0\fs46 \cf0 -based on bots state. Three lines emanate from the bot. One in the direction of the left edge of the cone, one the direction of the sensor, and one at the right edge of the cone. The distance to an environment wall is estimated with algebra. The minimum of these is take to be the minimum distance that a wall could potentially be sensed. Then if the sensor finds something less that 80% of that, then it is likely an object and is drawn. }
