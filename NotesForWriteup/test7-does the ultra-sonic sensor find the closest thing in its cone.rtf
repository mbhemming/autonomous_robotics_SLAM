\f0\fs32 \cf0 intent: Determine if the sensor picks up the closest object in it\'92s cone.\
\
method: Multiple configurations of objects were used which were within the the sensors cone. Then 100 readings were taken and see if the closes object was detected on all/most of the 100 readings. \
\
*Insert picture\
\
findings: The sensor did not find the closest object. Instead it received many hits on both objects in it\'92s field of view. \
\
consequences:\
	-We must take multiple measurements for a given orientation and position of the sensor to know all the objects that it\'92s seeing\
	-Seeing multiple objects in a field of view means that there are more than one arc that the objects could possibly be on. This leads us to two broad strategies for localizing objects. See appendix A}
