\f0\fs32 \cf0 -experiment\
	The results from test11 allow us to say for sure that there will be a single return distance, within a small tolerance. This leads to a quantitive approach of just taking the mean of many sensor measurements for a give \'91h\'92 and \'91theta\'92. If there were multiple return distances, then the mean wouldn\'92t be appropriate. For each pair of \'91h\'92 and \'91theta\'92, there were 300 samplings from the ultrasonic sensor and the arithmetic average was taken.\
	-This was only done on one half because a prior experiment showed symmetry in the sensor readings.\

	-sometimes we would get multiple returns while in the environment with not obstacles\
